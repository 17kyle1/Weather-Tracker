# Weather-Tracker
## Description
In this application, I attempt to create a 5 day weather forecast using Bootstrap and Third-Party-APIs. The application would contain a search form in which the user could search a city that they would receive a five day forecast report from. Unfortunately, I have run into some bugs in designing the Javascript portion of the page and the Front-End is not as polished as I would like. This would be a project I would love to come back and fix at a later date.![Screenshot 2023-05-30 105300](https://github.com/17kyle1/Weather-Tracker/assets/68515156/df95cc3e-f3d7-4116-bed9-4802fccfea58)
